# LLMs_Extractor

### Project description:
This project is focused on extracting information from PDFs using LLMs. 
The main objective is to transform unstructured data (financial certificates in pdfs) into a structured format (xml), thereby enhancing data usability and accessibility

### Data source:
Ariva sample data: financial certificates

### Approach:
The process involves using prompts to guide the extraction process. These prompts help in identifying and isolating relevant data within the PDFs. Once the data is extracted, it is then structured and organized into an XML format.

### Use case scenarios:
The benefit of this approach is that it allows for the efficient retrieval and utilization of data. By converting the data into a structured XML format, it becomes much easier to search, analyze, and manipulate the data (supporting the downstream system). This can be particularly useful in scenarios where large amounts of data need to be processed and analyzed quickly and accurately.
